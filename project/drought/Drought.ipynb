    "In this lab we will be discussing **Droughts** and **Wildfires** and looking at datasets as we dive deeper into the repercussions of climate change and determining if a noteable pattern can be discerned from looking at data from throughout the world. A drought is typically looked at as a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time (usually a season or more), resulting in a water shortage.‚Äù Droughts occur in many places around the world, even here in the US where the southwestern portion and even western portion of the US experiences droughts as you could see in the news over the past few years. Below is the data set we will be taking a closer look at, simply run the cell below to get started with the lab!"
