As a bit of background information to explain the results you have found based on these graphs, Tornado Valley is the part of the USA that covers 15% of US ground but results in over 30% of the tornados that touch down in the world! This valley should include states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Ohio! When looking at the latitudes, longitudes, and frequency of tornados by state, you should notice a clear trend in which areas of the US have the most tornados occur.
